      " In mid 90's, Peter Shor invented algorithms for quantum computers that will break all cryptographic algorithms that are the basis of today's Internet security. With advances in quantum technologies and prospect of quantum computers on the horizon, there is an urgent need to redesign cryptographic infrastructure of the Internet. This introductory talk explores quantum-safe cryptography, and approaches to build a secure internet in presence of quantum computers.",
